# Live Demo Overlay SaaS – Product Concept

## Overview
A lightweight multi-tenant SaaS platform + browser extension that enables B2B SaaS teams to deliver consistent, high-quality live demos on their **real product**, not a cloned or sandbox environment.

Sales reps can trigger flows that place overlays, highlights, and presenter notes directly on top of the live UI during a screen-share demo. This ensures consistent storytelling, reduces mistakes, and speeds up rep onboarding.

---

## Problems We Solve
### 1. Inconsistent demo delivery across reps
- Different reps present different flows.
- Some forget steps or skip critical parts.
- New reps take months to learn the “perfect demo.”

### 2. Unpredictable demo environments
- Staging often has missing or broken data.
- Reps waste time preparing accounts before every demo.

### 3. Reps forget what to say during the demo
- They juggle tabs, notes, slides, and checklists.
- They lose their narrative flow and reduce buyer confidence.

### 4. Slow onboarding of new sales reps
- New reps struggle to learn the right narrative.
- Tribal knowledge stays trapped with senior reps.

### 5. Demo preparation takes too long
- Reps rehearse manually.
- They check accounts to ensure charts look correct.
- They often do multiple dry runs before a real call.

## Why Now?
- SMB/mid-market SaaS teams do 5–50 demos/month.
- Traditional demo tools like Reprise/Saleo focus on enterprise.
- No lightweight, affordable overlay-based solution exists.
- Reps need guidance *inside* the real product, not slides or scripts.
